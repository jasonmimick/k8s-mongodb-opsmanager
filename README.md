# k8s-mongodb-opsmanager

This repo contains a set of *ALPHA* version
scripts to run MongoDB clusters by integrating
various container orchestration frameworks such as
GCE/GKE, OpenShift, and Mesosphere with
Kuberenetes and MongoDB Ops Manager.

These are development artifacts and for demonstration
purposes only. They will be used to develop officially
supported integrations.
